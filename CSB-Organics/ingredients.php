					<h1 class="section-title text-center">100% NATURAL INGREDIENTS IN ALL OUR PRODUCTS</h1>
					<p><strong>Benefits of Beeswax for the Skin</strong></p>
					<p>The health benefits of beeswax for the skin are almost too many to count. Obviously, one of the best benefits of using beeswax on the skin is the moisturizing and the softening. Unlike the artificial and often petroleum based chemicals added to many moisturizers and skin care lotions to aid in absorption, beeswax contains Vitamin A and provides long-term moisturizing, actually locking moisture into the skin. Unlike petroleum based parabens, beeswax remains biologically “alive” even after it is processed!</p>
					<p><strong>Healing Properties of Beeswax for Skin & Allergies, Irritation</strong></p>
					<p>Besides offering your skin a natural moisture and glow, the anti-allergenic and anti-inflammatory properties of bees wax can actually soothe easily irritated skin, making it one of the best skin care ingredients for those who suffer from allergies or other skin problems like rosacea or eczema. Along with being a good alternative skin care ingredient for those with allergies, the anti-germicidal properties of beeswax have been found to help heal minor skin cuts, abrasions, scrapes and wounds. Beeswax also acts as a layer of protection when applied to the skin, protecting the skin from environmental irritants and even the weather. Beeswax lip balm is one of the best ways to keep your lips from getting chapped during these cold and windy winter months!</p>
					<p><strong>Ranunculus Ficaria Extract</strong></p>
					<p>Soothes and calms irritated skin while reducing redness. Contains phenolic derivatives such as rutin and tri-terpenic saponins that help decongest skin tissue and reduce blotchiness. Rananculus used as an emollient, it improves the overall skin condition. ... widelyused in color cosmetic products. pilewort extract (Ranunculus ficaria)—also ... It isused in cosmetic preparations as a skin conditioner and skin freshener.</p>
					<p><strong>Blueberry As Both A Superfood And Skin Care Treatment</strong></p>
					<p>Blueberries have many uses as blueberry extract has been used in ancient herbal and medicinal treatments for thousands of years. Many skin care treatments now use blends of blueberry extracts along with other herbs to help revitalize the skin and hasten healing. These treatments have been clinically proven to decrease healing time for skin peels, especially deeper skin peels like the TCA skin peel. They have also shown marked ability at reducing scarring in wound and burn treatment, although more research is needed. Blueberries are rich in fiber as well as vitamins A and C, while low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium. They are also a good source of antioxidants, and can be eaten raw, cooked with other foods, or dried for use in tea. No matter what form blueberries take in your diet, their many vitamins and nutrients can be good for your skin. Whether you suffer from acne, broken capillaries or splotchy skin, the nutrients in blueberries will help.</p>
					<p><strong>Your Circulatory Health</strong></p>
					<p>Breaking of the capillaries under your skin can occur under a hard impact, which often leads to bruising, but it can also occur due to weakness within the vessel walls. When this occurs, skin may become splotchy, or tiny red lines may be visible under your skin. Sometimes called "spider veins," these broken capillaries can be unsightly and may take months or years to heal and disappear. The stronger your capillaries, the more resistance they are to breaking. The vitamin C in The antioxidants and phytochemicals found in blueberries help to neutralize free radicals, which might otherwise damage skin cells, leaving your skin with a younger and softer look and feel. A diet high in fat and carbohydrates can also encourage skin aging, so blueberries prevent aging by providing you with many needed nutrients while providing very low levels of fat and cholesterol. blueberries can help to strengthen the blood vessels just below the surface of your skin.</p>
					<p><strong>CUCUMBERS</strong></p>
					<p>The older you get, the fewer antioxidants you have in your skin to combat wrinkles and sun damage -- cucumbers can help restore some of these. Your skin has the ability to absorb antioxidants. Cucumbers are a source of several compounds that fight inflammation and aging, including cucurbitacins and cucumerin.</p>
					<h6>Vitamin Rich</h6>
					<p>Cucumbers contain vitamin C, an antioxidant. They also have plenty of vitamin K, also an antioxidant, which fights dark circles under the eyes. This is why a couple of cucumber slices placed over tired, puffy eyes in the morning makes you look refreshed. Pantothenic acid, or vitamin B-5, is another compound found in cucumbers that helps your skin retain moisture. The vitamin A, or retinol, in cucumbers fights dark spots and freckles because it helps control your skin's production of melanin.</p>
					<h6>Wrinkle Fighter</h6>
					<p>Wrinkle Fighter Cucumbers are a source of silica, which, as a precursor to collagen, can help fight wrinkles. A May 2011 issue of the "Archives of Dermatological Research" published a study concluding that the presence of ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, makes cucumber juice a particular effective ingredient in anti-wrinkle products. You can add cucumber juice to your favorite lotion or make a toner by grating a cucumber, straining out the juice through cheesecloth and mixing it with an equal amount of witch hazel or rose water. Use a cotton ball to apply it to your face.</p>
					<h6>Skin Irritations</h6>
					<p>Cucumbers have high water content and a cooling quality, making them appropriate to help soothe mild burns, particularly sunburn. They can also reduce swelling and relieve minor skin irritations, reported a review published in the journal "Fitoterapia" in 2013.</p>
					<p><strong>Lanolin Cream:</strong></p>
					<p>Its Properties, Uses, and Benefits The soothing, moisturizing, and healing effects of lanolin cream have been known to benefit nearly every skin type. This cream has been used for decades in a wide variety of applications, from lotions that soften rough heels, to soothing severely dry skin, and easing the chapped and cracked skin on the nipples of nursing mothers. Lanolin is a natural and organic chemical that is mainly known for its moisturizing effects on the skin. However, before anyone uses a lanolin cream as a part of their skin care regimen, it is important to be aware of any possible side effects that can occur.</p>
					<p><strong>Lanolin Cream Properties</strong></p>
					<p>Lanolin cream is mostly comprised of lanolin oil, which is extracted from sheep’s wool. The oil occurs naturally within the wool and is taken out before the wool is processed to make clothing and other products. Most lanolin cream products contain other ingredients, but there are also products that contain only pure lanolin oil. Its moisturizing properties are highly valued in a number of skin care treatments because it penetrates deeper into dry skin, and doesn’t just moisturize, but also creates a barrier in the underlying layers of skin to prevent moisture from escaping. This keeps skin supple longer, which means that those who use lanolin cream don’t have to apply it as often.</p>
					<p><strong>Healing Properties</strong></p>
					<p>While lanolin cream is used widely in beauty regimens, it is also well known for use on skin that is cracked or extremely dry. People who suffer from calloused heels and hands can benefit from this cream, as it helps the skin to retain its natural moisture in addition to the moisture contained within the cream. Lanolin cream is also popular with people who have reoccurring skin conditions that cause scaling and itching skin, as the moisturizing properties of this cream ease the itching, while making the skin softer. Skin that is dry, cracked, and bleeding from extreme weather conditions can also benefit from lanolin cream, as the moisture barrier it creates keeps the skin from repeatedly cracking and helps to seal in moisture.</p>
					<p><strong>Lanolin Cream as Part of a Skin Care Regimen</strong></p>
					<p>Anyone who is fighting overly dry and thickening skin may want to consider adding a lanolin cream to their skin care regimen. Women who wear sandals or high heels often find that the skin on their heels starts to thicken, crack, and peel from friction and exposure. When this happens, everyday moisturizers usually have no effect on skin that is this damaged, because they cannot penetrate deeply enough into the layers. Over time, the skin continues to thicken and becomes scaly and even discolored. However, a lanolin cream can penetrate the layers of dead skin to soften them so that they can be removed with exfoliating tools, leaving the skin on the heel smoother and moisturized. It is usually most effective to apply a lanolin cream before you go to bed so that it sinks into the skin overnight and penetrates the dead layers for easy removal the following morning.</p>
